Actix-web supports WebSockets with the `actix-web-actors` crate. It is possible to convert a
request's `Payload` to a stream of [*ws::Message*][message] with a [*web::Payload*][payload]
and then use stream combinators to handle actual messages, but it is simpler to handle
websocket communications with an http actor.

The following is an example of a simple websocket echo server:

> A simple websocket echo server example is available in the [examples directory][examples].

> An example chat server with the ability to chat over a websocket or TCP connection
> is available in [websocket-chat directory][chat]
