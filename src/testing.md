# Testing

Every application should be well tested. Actix-web provides tools to perform unit and
integration tests.

# Unit Tests

For unit testing, actix-web provides a request builder type.
[*TestRequest*][testrequest] implements a builder-like pattern. You can generate a
`HttpRequest` instance with `to_http_request()` and call your handler with it.

# Integration tests

There are a few methods for testing your application. Actix-web can be used
to run the application with specific handlers in a real HTTP server.

`TestRequest::get()`, `TestRequest::post()` and other
methods can be used to send requests to the test server.

To create a `Service` for testing, use the `test::init_service` method which accepts a
regular `App` builder.

> Check the [API documentation][actixdocs] for more information.

If you need more complex application configuration, testing should be very similar to creating
the normal application. For example, you may need to initialize application state. Create an
`App` with a `data` method and attach state just like you would from a normal application.

# Stream response tests

If you need to test stream generation, it would be enough to call `take_body()` and convert a
resulting [*ResponseBody*][responsebody] into a future and execute it, for example when testing
[*Server Sent Events*][serversentevents].
